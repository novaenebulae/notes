        <li>
            <p>&quot;What key component movies, games, theater have in common, that is mandatory to give people feels, but
                not even visible ?</p>
            <p> <strong>SOUND of course !</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Sound design is a common thread that binds so many of the arts. Great sound has the power to give audiences
                feelings, and create unforgettable moments.”</p>
